        How these people teach you for good reasons
    </h2>
    <p>
        Network Chuck, A youtuber, teaches us how to make websites and other stuff and he taught me how to make my first ever wbesite myself. Without his great compassion teaching us how to code website, we would be in square one
    </p>
    <p>This Female women teaching us how to make a simple website helped me a lot without her teaching skills, i wouldn't be a web developer</p>
    <h2> 
        My Greatest reason
    </h2>
    <p>
        I joined ICT to learn about coding, but going step by step is taking to long for me so I watched network chuck's channel to learn making websites. He improved my skills on making this website without crazy ideas. This helpout alot

        rename that text document to index.html, open the text document, Next get your coding software and open the index.html 
        in the coding software
